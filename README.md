Savings and CD Account Interest Calculator
This is a simple Python program I made to calculate the interest earned on savings and CD (Certificate of Deposit) accounts. You just need to enter the initial balance, interest rate, and the number of months. The program then calculates the updated balance and interest earned for both account types.

Installation
1. Install Python: Ensure Python is installed on your computer. You can download it from python.org.

2. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/savings-cd-calculator.git
cd savings-cd-calculator

3. Check the files: Make sure main.py, Account.py, savings_account.py, and cd_account.py are all in the same folder.

Usage
4. Run the main.py script to start the program:
python main.py

What the Program Does
1. Prompts for savings account details (balance, interest rate, months).
2. Calculates and displays the updated savings balance and interest earned.
3. Prompts for CD account details (balance, interest rate, months).
4. Calculates and displays the updated CD balance and interest earned.

Example output:
1. Please enter your savings account balance: 1000
2. Please enter your savings account interest rate: 5
3. Please enter number of months to maturity: 12
4. Your updated savings account balance is 1,050.00
5. Your interest earned on the savings account is 50.00
6. Please enter your CD account balance: 2000
7. Please enter your CD account interest rate: 3
8. Please enter number of months to maturity: 12
9. Your updated CD account balance is 2,060.00
10. Your interest earned on the CD account is 60.00
